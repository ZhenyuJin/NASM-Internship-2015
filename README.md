# NASM-Internship-2015
Exhibit Technology / Electrical Engineering Intern at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

A collection of projects I worked on while interning at the Air and Space museum. Project files are saved in individual folders; project descriptions are listed below.


### [Moon-to-Earth at light speed exhibit](https://github.com/zjin666/NASM-Internship-2015/tree/master/Moon-to-Earth)
An interactive exhibit showing how long it takes light to travel from the moon to the earth (~1.3 seconds). Built using 28 solid state relays, two 16-output decoders, a bank of LEDs and an Arduino. Written in C/C++. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Capacitive Touch Keyboard Piano exhibit](https://github.com/zjin666/NASM-Internship-2015/tree/master/Capacitive%20Touch%20Piano)
An interactive exhibit intended to show that the visibile portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is analogous to one octave on a piano. Built using an MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor and a VS1053 Music Player Shield w/ microSD Card, both from Adafruit, as well as an Arduino. View in person at the Air and Space Museum in D.C.

### [Timeline of Jet Aviation Video Selector exhibit](https://github.com/zjin666/NASM-Internship-2015/tree/master/Timeline%20of%20Jet%20Aviation)
An interactive video selector. Visitors press numbered buttons to select videos from a large video catalogue. The videos depict the advances in design and technology of jet-powered aircraft, from early, prototypical jets like the Bell XP-59A to a variety of specialized, modern jets like the Lockheed SR-71 and the Airbus A300. The exhibit has a simple design on the surface, but like everything else at the museum, it was necessary to take many more details into account while designing the user interface.

### [Expanding Space mechanical exhibit](https://github.com/zjin666/NASM-Internship-2015/tree/master/Expanding%20Space)
An interactive exhibit intended to show how the expansion of the universe means the space between galaxies expands/distance between galaxies increases. Built using a bicycle mechanism, and spring to return to original position, with foam-core galaxies painted flourescent green glued to black spandex. Our job as interns was to replace the white LEDs with 400nm, near ultraviolet LEDS that would make the galaxies "glow" as the original design, as well as to perform a maintenance overhaul to worn out pieces. No programmable electronics here!

### [Pixelator live video camera exhibit](https://github.com/zjin666/NASM-Internship-2015/tree/master/Pixelator)
An interactive camera exhibit that demonstrates the concept of pixels and camera resolution. In the context of the the 'Looking at Earth' gallery, this exhibit illustrates how early earth-facing satellites were limited by low resolution, while newer ones can see much greater detail due to advances in camera resolution. The exhibit greatly simplifies the concept, and puts the user in control so that one can understand and interact with the idea of pixels and resolution.

### [Around the World in 18 days NFC exhibit](https://github.com/zjin666/NASM-Internship-2015/tree/master/Around%20the%20World)
In 1936, Herbet Ekins flew around the world flying only on commercially operated flights. This interactive exhibit gives visitors a better understanding of this first-in-history journey that took 18 days. My job as an intern was to replace the old hydraulic and counter-weights system that was powering the exhibit in the past. This system had stopped working many years ago due to it's mechanical complexity. This was by far the most complicated exhibit I designed and built during my internship.
